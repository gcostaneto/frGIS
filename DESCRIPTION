Description: Returns factorial regression from phenotypic and environmental data. 
             The number of phenotypic observations can not exceed the number of parameters 
             (coefficients of the genotypes for each covariate) 
             to be estimated. Note: the model is based on ordinary least squares (OLS) and 
             multicollinearity effects are not removed from the analysis.Future updates of the 
             function will allow FR modeling based on Bayesian inference (Gibbs-sampling) and partial least squares (PLS).
